# SDET coding challenge

Here you are! We're ecstatic that you're interested in working for Quantum Inventions's QA team. To get a better idea of your current automation skills, we'd like you to complete a code challenge - build automation according to a set of requirements. The actual requirements are listed further down, but here are the general tech requirements:

- Write your code in any programming language of your choice
- Make sure your app is runnable not only on Windows, but on Mac OS X and Linux as well.
- Do not require any for-pay software
- Include instructions for setting up and running your application
- Containerized app is a plus

## Description

Write tests to load the Mapsynq (http://www.mapsynq.com) website, design and implement all important test cases (be ready to explain importance). 
**Complete the assignment as you would do for the real-life production environment.**

### Automation requirements

- The automation must run via the UI within a browser
- Your solution must produce a detailed and clean report file

### Functional requirements

- Tests are runnable from the command line
- Tests are run against a configurable host, use http://www.mapsynq.com as the default
- Tests can be configured to run on a various browser and OS combinations against a testing service
- Testing service credentials and all configuration settings are passed as environment variables
- Tests are run in parallel
- Tests run against mobile browsers

### Bonus

- Tests run headlessly
- Tests capture screenshots of failures 

## What we're looking for

- POM approach to project structure and use of **generic** xpaths/css paths
- Using high-quality existing libraries or small amounts of custom code
- Showing your work through your **commit history**
- Polish
- Pride in craftsmanship

## What we care

- Test Case quality and adequacy 
- Architecture:
    - How clean and reasonable is the separation between modules?
- Clarity:
    - Does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? 
    - Are technical tradeoffs explained?
- Code quality: 
    - Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
    - Are there any code smells or other red flags? 
    - Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? 
    - Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? 
    - Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- Correctness:
    - If there is anything missing?
    - Does the README explain why it is missing?

Please submit your work by sending us a link to a GitHub repo with your code.
