### SDE coding challenge

Here you are! We're ecstatic that you're interested in working for Quantum Inventions. 
To get a better idea of your current skills, we'd like you to complete a code challenge - build an API according to a set of requirements. The actual requirements are listed further down, but here are the general tech requirements:
- Make sure your app is runnable not only on Windows, but on Mac OS X and Linux as well.
- Do not require any for-pay software
- Include instructions for setting up and running your application
- Containerized app is a plus

### Description

- `GET`  `/files` - retrieves a list of files from [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket
- `GET`  `/files/:id` - retrieves a spicific file
- `POST` `/files` - uploads file into S3 bucket
- `DELETE` `/files/:id` - removes file from S3 bucket

**Complete the assignment as you would do for the real-life production environment.**
> Write your code in any programming language of your choice.

    - Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
    - Are there any code smells or other red flags? 
    - Does code follow SOLID principles? 
    - Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? 
    - Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
